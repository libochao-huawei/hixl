## Sample Configuration

- Some samples support RDMA links in A5 environments and must be executed on dual hosts. These samples will be noted explicitly in the corresponding sample descriptions. In A5 environments, if `local_comm_res` is not manually configured, the UB protocol is used by default; to use RDMA links, you need to manually configure `local_comm_res`. For configuration details, refer to [**Table 2** options (Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT)](../../docs/zh/api/cpp/HIXL-interface.md#initialize). You can obtain the host NIC IP information using the following commands:
  ```shell
  # Query the mapping between RoCE devices and network ports, and identify the ports in Up state
  ibdev2netdev

  # Find the corresponding IP addresses using the network ports
  ifconfig
  ```

## Program Build

1. Refer to the **Compile and Execute** section in [Build](../../docs/en/build.md) and use `bash build.sh --examples` to compile.

2. After compilation, multiple executable files are generated in the **build/examples/cpp** directory.

## Sample Running

### 1. LLM-DataDist Samples

  - Note:

    - All samples must run in pairs. The execution interval between the prompt and decoder sides should not be too long. In the samples, the decoder side sets `WAIT_PROMPT_TIME` to 5s, and the prompt side sets `WAIT_TIME` to 10s. You may adjust these values according to your actual environment to ensure successful execution.
    - The following samples assume that the prompt and decoder run on the same machine. Set `local_ip` and `remote_ip` to the same value.

  - Configure environment variables
    - If "Ascend-cann-toolkit" package is installed in the runtime environment, set the environment variables as follows:

        ```cpp
        source ${HOME}/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
        ```

        Replace "${HOME}/Ascend" with the actual software installation path.

    - If "CANN-XXX.run" package is installed in the runtime environment, set the environment variables as follows:

        ```cpp
        source ${HOME}/Ascend/latest/bin/setenv.bash
        ```

        Replace "${HOME}/Ascend" with the actual software installation path.

  - Run the executable files in the runtime environment.

    (1) Run pull_cache_and_blocks

    This sample demonstrates the workflow where the decoder pulls cache and blocks from the prompt. The direction of link setup and pull operations is independent of role assignment and can be modified as needed. The default transfer backend is ADXL; pass optional `transfer_backend` as `hixl` to switch to the hixl cs backend. A5 environments only support the hixl cs backend, which uses the UB protocol by default; you can manually configure `local_comm_res` to use RDMA links.

    - Run prompt_pull_cache_and_blocks with parameters device_id, local_ip, and optional transfer_backend and local_comm_res, where device_id is the device ID used by the prompt, and local_ip is the IP address of the host where the prompt runs. For example:

        ```cpp
        ./prompt_pull_cache_and_blocks 0 10.10.170.1 hixl
        ```

    - Run decoder_pull_cache_and_blocks with parameters device_id, local_ip, remote_ip, and optional transfer_backend and local_comm_res, where device_id is the device ID used by the decoder, local_ip is the IP address of the host where the decoder runs, and remote_ip is the IP address of the host where the prompt runs. For example:

        ```cpp
        ./decoder_pull_cache_and_blocks 2 10.170.10.1 10.170.10.1 hixl
        ```

    (2) Run push_cache_and_blocks

    This sample demonstrates the workflow where the prompt pushes cache and blocks to the decoder. The direction of link setup and push operations is independent of role assignment and can be modified as needed. The default transfer backend is HCCL; pass optional `transfer_backend` as `hixl` to use the hixl backend. In A5 environments with hixl, the UB protocol is used by default; you can manually configure `local_comm_res` to use RDMA links.

    - Run prompt_push_cache_and_blocks with parameters device_id, local_ip, remote_ip, and optional transfer_backend and local_comm_res, where device_id is the device ID used by the prompt, local_ip is the IP address of the host where the prompt runs, and remote_ip is the IP address of the host running the decoder. For example:

        ```cpp
        ./prompt_push_cache_and_blocks 0 10.10.10.1 10.10.10.1 hixl
        ```

    - Run decoder_push_cache_and_blocks with parameters device_id, local_ip, and optional transfer_backend and local_comm_res, where device_id is the device ID used by the decoder, and local_ip is the IP address of the host where the decoder runs. For example:

        ```cpp
        ./decoder_push_cache_and_blocks 4 10.10.10.1 hixl
        ```

    (3) Run switch_roles

    This sample demonstrates prompt and decoder role switching combined with pull and push workflows.

    - Run prompt_switch_roles with parameters device_id, local_ip and remote_ip, where device_id is the device ID used by the prompt, local_ip is the IP address of the host where the prompt runs, and remote_ip is the IP address of the host where the decoder runs. For example:

        ```cpp
        ./prompt_switch_roles 0 10.10.170.1 10.170.10.1
        ```

    - Run decoder_switch_roles with parameters device_id, local_ip and remote_ip, where device_id is the device ID used by the decoder, local_ip is the IP address of the host where the decoder runs, and remote_ip is the IP address of the host where the prompt runs. For example:

        ```cpp
        ./decoder_switch_roles 2 10.170.10.1 10.170.10.1
        ```

### 2. HIXL Samples

  - Note:

    - Single-process samples (hixl_example_d2rd, hixl_example_d2rh) start two engines in one process, no need for separate terminals. Supported on CANN-9.1.0 or later.
    - Multi-process sample (hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc) requires starting server and client in two separate terminals. Server starts first. No CANN version requirement.
    - ubmem_d2d must run in pairs, started in two terminals.

  - Configure environment variables
    - If "Ascend-cann-toolkit" package is installed in the runtime environment, set the environment variables as follows:

        ```cpp
        source ${HOME}/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
        ```

        Replace "${HOME}/Ascend" with the actual software installation path.

    - If "CANN-XXX.run" package is installed in the runtime environment, set the environment variables as follows:

        ```cpp
        source ${HOME}/Ascend/latest/bin/setenv.bash
        ```

        Replace "${HOME}/Ascend" with the actual software installation path.

  - Run the executable files in the runtime environment.

    (1) Run hixl_example_d2rd, D2RD single-process scenario

      - Note:
        - Single-process starts two engines in one thread, each binding to a different device. Engine A initiates WRITE transfer to Engine B's device buffer.

      - Example:

          ```cpp
          # Use roce:device protocol
          ./hixl_example_d2rd --protocol=roce:device

          # Specify device
          ./hixl_example_d2rd --protocol=roce:device --device=0,2

          # Use version 0 mode (only supports roce:device)
          ./hixl_example_d2rd --protocol=roce:device --version=0
          ```

    (2) Run hixl_example_d2rh, D2RH single-process scenario

      - Note:
        - Single-process starts two engines in one thread, each binding to a different device. Both sides initiate WRITE transfer to each other's host buffer.

      - Example:

          ```cpp
          # Use roce:device protocol
          ./hixl_example_d2rh --protocol=roce:device

          # Use UB CTP pure URMA protocol
          ./hixl_example_d2rh --protocol=ub_ctp

          # The original Device+Host form also uses pure URMA
          ./hixl_example_d2rh --protocol=ub_ctp:device,ub_ctp:host

          # Use version 0 mode
          ./hixl_example_d2rh --protocol=roce:device --version=0
          ```

    (3) Run hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc, D2RD multi-process scenario

      - Note:
        - Two independent processes start engines separately. After exchanging buffer addresses via socket, the client initiates READ transfer and verifies locally.

      - Example:

          ```cpp
          # Use roce protocol
          ./hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc --role=server --protocol=roce:device
          ./hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc --role=client --protocol=roce:device

          # Use hccs protocol
          ./hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc --role=server --protocol=hccs:device
          ./hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc --role=client --protocol=hccs:device

          # Use version 0 mode
          ./hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc --role=server --protocol=roce:device --version=0
          ./hixl_example_d2rd_multiproc --role=client --protocol=roce:device --version=0
          ```

    (4) Run ubmem_d2d, UBMEM mode D2D scenario

    **Note**:

    - FabricMem only supports Atlas A3 training series products / Atlas A3 inference series products, with a minimum HDK version of 25.5.
    - HDK 25.5 does not support `aclrtMemRetainAllocationHandle`. On this version, Host memory in FabricMem scenarios must be allocated and freed using the ADXL-provided `MallocMem`/`FreeMem`.
    - HDK 26.0 and above can directly use ACL interfaces to manage Host memory in FabricMem scenarios.
    - The current `ubmem_d2d` example directly uses ACL VMM interfaces `aclrtReserveMemAddress`, `aclrtMallocPhysical`, and `aclrtMapMem` in `AllocateBuffer` to allocate memory, then registers it as `MEM_DEVICE`, rather than allocating through ADXL's `AdxlEngine::MallocMem`. This registration path requires `aclrtMemRetainAllocationHandle`, so the example requires HDK 26.0 or later and is not compatible with HDK 25.5. The `aclrtMallocHost`/`aclrtFreeHost` in the example are only used for initialization and buffer verification, not for UBMEM Host memory registration.

      - Run server1 ubmem_d2d with parameters device_id, local engine and remote engine, where device_id is the device ID used by the current engine. For example:

          ```cpp
          ./ubmem_d2d 0 127.0.0.1:16000 127.0.0.1:16001
          ```

      - Run server2 ubmem_d2d with parameters device_id, local engine and remote engine, where device_id is the device ID used by the current engine. For example:

          ```cpp
          ./ubmem_d2d 1 127.0.0.1:16001 127.0.0.1:16000
          ```
