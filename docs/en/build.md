# Build from Source Code

## Environment Setup

This project supports build from source code. Before compiling the source code, ensure that the CANN Toolkit has been installed. Before running all samples, ensure that the driver and firmware have been installed. Before running Python samples, ensure that the OPS package has been installed.

Select an installation method based on the following description:

| Installation Mode | Description                                                                                                                       | Scenario |
| :--- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| :--- |
| Deployment using Docker | Docker images provide an efficient CANN deployment method. Currently, it applies to Atlas A2, A3, and A5 products with Ubuntu OS. | This method is suitable for developers who have Ascend devices and need to quickly set up the environment. |
| Manual installation | -                                                                                                                                 | This method is suitable for developers who have Ascend devices and want to manually install the CANN package or experience the latest master branch capabilities. |

### Scenario I: Deployment Using Docker

**1. Install the firmware and driver.** See [CANN Software Installation](https://www.hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstWizard).

**2. Install the dependencies, CANN Toolkit, and CANN ops package.**

 - **Pull the x86 build image**: `docker pull --platform=amd64 swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.1-a3-ubuntu22.04-py3.12-devel`
 - **Pull the Arm build image**: `docker pull --platform=arm64 swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.1-a3-ubuntu22.04-py3.12-devel`

   The commands above show how to download images for the A3 environment. For more image versions and usage instructions, see [Ascend-CANN Images](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/ascendhub/detail/17da20d1c2b6493cb38765adeba85884). Recommended usage:

   ```bash
   image=swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.0.1-a3-ubuntu22.04-py3.12-devel

   # Create and access the container
   # Assume that your NPU devices are installed in /dev/davinci0 and /dev/davinci1, and the NPU driver is installed in /usr/local/Ascend.
   docker run \
     --name env_for_hixl_build \
     --device /dev/davinci0 \
     --device /dev/davinci1 \
     --device /dev/davinci_manager \
     --device /dev/devmm_svm \
     --device /dev/hisi_hdc \
     --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
     -v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
     -v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
     -v /usr/bin/hccn_tool:/usr/bin/hccn_tool \
     -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
     -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/tools/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/tools/ \
     -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
     -v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
     -it ${image} bash
   ```

   > [!NOTE] Note
   > - `--cap-add SYS_PTRACE`: Adds the `SYS_PTRACE` permission when creating a Docker to support memory leak detection during [local verification (Tests)](#local-verification-tests).
   > - The AscendHub CANN devel image starts as the `root` user by default. The image already includes cmake, gcc, git, and other build tools.
   > - For more Docker options, run the `docker --help` command.

   The installation path of the CANN package for the build image is `/usr/local/Ascend` (environment script: `/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh`). If you need to use a different CANN version outside the image, manually install the CANN package in Docker by referring to the following sections.

#### A5 (Atlas 950) Container Configuration

The A5 environment requires additional device and mount configurations beyond the common options above; otherwise topology discovery and UB network communication will fail inside the container. The following command is for reference (using the 9.1.0-950 image as an example):

   ```bash
   image=swr.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/ascendhub/cann:9.1.0-950-openeuler24.03-py3.12

    # Create and access the container
    # Assume that your NPU devices are /dev/davinci0 - /dev/davinci7 (8 cards), and the NPU driver is installed in /usr/local/Ascend:
    docker run -it \
      --name env_for_hixl_build_a5 \
      --network host \
      --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
      --device /dev/davinci0 \
      --device /dev/davinci1 \
      --device /dev/davinci2 \
      --device /dev/davinci3 \
      --device /dev/davinci4 \
      --device /dev/davinci5 \
      --device /dev/davinci6 \
      --device /dev/davinci7 \
      --device /dev/davinci_manager \
      --device /dev/hisi_hdc \
      --device /dev/ummu \
      --device /dev/uburma \
     -v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
     -v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
     -v /usr/bin/hccn_tool:/usr/bin/hccn_tool \
     -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
     -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/tools/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/tools/ \
     -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/topo/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/topo/ \
     -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
     -v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
     ${image} bash
   ```

   > [!NOTE] Note
   > - Compared with the A2/A3 common configuration, the following configurations are mandatory on A5:
   >   - `--device /dev/ummu` and `--device /dev/uburma`: user-space devices required for UB network communication.
   >   - `-v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/topo/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/topo/`: topology directory. Without this mount, topology discovery inside the container fails.
   >   - `--network host`: reuses the host network namespace.
   > - `/dev/devmm_svm` is the A2/A3 memory management device and is not required on A5.
   > - Adjust the device numbers (`/dev/davinciN`) according to the actual number of installed cards.

### Scenario II: Manual Installation

**Scenario 1: Experience the master branch or perform development based on the master branch.**

If you want to experience the latest capabilities of the master branch, download the software package from [the download link](https://ascend.devcloud.huaweicloud.com/artifactory/cann-run-mirror/software/master) and perform the following steps. For detailed instructions, see [CANN Software Installation](https://www.hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstWizard).

1. Install the firmware and driver. See [CANN Software Installation](https://www.hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstWizard).

2. Install the community edition CANN Toolkit.

    ```bash
    # Ensure that the installation package is executable
    chmod +x Ascend-cann-toolkit_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run
    # Installation command
    ./Ascend-cann-toolkit_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run --install --install-path=${install_path}
    ```

3. Install the community edition CANN ops package.

    ```bash
    # Ensure that the installation package is executable
    chmod +x Ascend-cann-${soc_name}-ops_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run
    # Installation command
    ./Ascend-cann-${soc_name}-ops_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run --install --install-path=${install_path}
    ```

    - `${cann_version}`: CANN package version.
    - `${arch}`: CPU architecture, such as `aarch64` and `x86_64`.
    - `${soc_name}`: NPU model identifier used in the ops package name. Select it based on the chip model as follows:

      | Chip model | `${soc_name}` | Example ops package |
      | :--- | :--- | :--- |
      | Ascend910 | `A3` | `Ascend-cann-A3-ops_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run` |
      | Ascend910B | `910b` | `Ascend-cann-910b-ops_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run` |
      | Ascend950 | `950` | `Ascend-cann-950-ops_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run` |

    - `${install_path}`: installation path. The CANN package and Toolkit package must be in the same path. For the `root` user, the default path is `/usr/local/Ascend`.

**Scenario 2: Experience a released version or perform development based on a released version.**

To experience the capabilities of the **officially released CANN package**, visit [the CANN download center](https://www.hiascend.com/cann/download) and select the CANN package (CANN 8.5.0 or later).

## Environment Verification

After installing the CANN packages, verify that the environment and driver are normal.

- **Check NPUs.**

    ```bash
    # Run the npu-smi command. If the device information is displayed properly, the driver is normal.
    npu-smi info
    ```

- **Check CANN installation.**

    ```bash
    # Check the version field of CANN Toolkit (default installation path). <arch> indicates the CPU architecture (AArch64 or x86_64).
    cat /usr/local/Ascend/cann/<arch>-linux/ascend_toolkit_install.info
    # Check the version field of CANN ops package (default installation path). <arch> indicates the CPU architecture (AArch64 or x86_64).
    cat /usr/local/Ascend/cann/<arch>-linux/ascend_ops_install.info
    ```

## Environment Variable Configuration

Run the appropriate command to make the environment variables take effect.

```bash
# Docker build image (AscendHub CANN image; see [Scenario I: Deployment Using Docker](#scenario-i-deployment-using-docker))
source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh

# Manual installation: default path (using the root user as an example; for a non-root user, replace /usr/local with ${HOME})
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
# Custom installation path
# source ${install_path}/cann/set_env.sh
```

## Source Code Compilation

### Install Third-Party Open-Source Dependencies

The following lists the dependencies required for source code compilation. Check the version requirements.

  ```shell
  # Run the following commands for Ubuntu/Debian. Use proper commands for other OS.
  sudo apt-get install cmake bash patch ccache
  ```

- GCC 7.3.x - 14.2.x
- Python 3.9.x - 3.14.x
- CMake >= 3.16.0
- bash >= 5.1.16 (Address sanitization is enabled in the test cases. Low versions of bash may trigger false memory leak detections in `system` calls.)
- unzip (extracts the ZIP packages of third-party open-source software)
- patch (applies patches to third-party open-source software during compilation)
- ccache (optional, a compiler cache optimization tool used to speed up incremental builds)

During compilation, HIXL depends on the following third-party open-source software.

| Open-Source Software | Version | Download Address |
|---|---|---|
| googletest | 1.14.0 | [googletest-1.14.0.tar.gz](https://gitcode.com/cann-src-third-party/googletest/releases/download/v1.14.0/googletest-1.14.0.tar.gz) |
| json | 3.12.0 | [json-3.12.0.tar.gz](https://gitcode.com/cann-src-third-party/json/releases/download/v3.12.0/json-3.12.0.tar.gz) |
| makeself | 2.5.0 | [makeself-release-2.5.0.tar.gz](https://cann-3rd.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/makeself/makeself-release-2.5.0.tar.gz), [makeself-2.5.0.patch](https://cann-3rd.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/makeself/fix/makeself-2.5.0.patch) |
| pybind11 | 2.13.6 | [pybind11-2.13.6.tar.gz](https://gitcode.com/cann-src-third-party/pybind11/releases/download/v2.13.6/pybind11-2.13.6.tar.gz) |
| cann-cmake | master-059 | [cmake-master-059.tar.gz](https://raw.gitcode.com/cann/cmake/archive/refs/heads/master-059.tar.gz) |

> [!NOTE] Note
> If you download the packages from other addresses, ensure that the version numbers match exactly.

### Download Source Code

Run the following commands to download the source code of this repository:
```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/cann/hixl.git
```

> [!NOTE] Note
> When using HTTPS on GitCode, configure and use a personal access token instead of the login password for operations such as cloning and pushing.

If your build environment cannot access the Internet, you cannot download code via `git`. In this case, you need to download the source code in an environment with Internet access and manually upload it to the target environment.

- In an environment with Internet access, go to [the project homepage](https://gitcode.com/cann/hixl), and download the source code via `ZIP download` or `clone`.
- Connect to the offline environment and upload the source code to the specified directory. If you download a compressed package, decompress it.

### Compile Source Code

- If your build environment can access the Internet, the compilation process will automatically download the required third-party open-source software listed above. Run the following command to perform the compilation:

  ```bash
  # Default installation path (root user: /usr/local/Ascend; non-root user: ${HOME}/Ascend)
  bash build.sh

  # If you do not modify the source code or your changes do not involve code under `src/ops`, add the "--host" option
  bash build.sh --host

  # If you need to compile C++ samples or benchmark tests, specify the "--examples" parameter
  bash build.sh --examples
  ```

- If your build environment cannot access the Internet, prepare the third-party open-source software listed above in an environment with Internet access and upload it to your build environment. The following two methods are supported:

  - Method 1 (recommended): Use the one-click third-party software download and packaging script provided by the HIXL repository.

    Run the following command in the root directory of the HIXL repository in the environment with Internet access. After the command is executed successfully, `opensource.tar.gz` is generated in the repository root directory:

    ```bash
    bash scripts/download_third_party_source.sh
    ```

    In the offline environment, upload the source repository and `opensource.tar.gz`, and then run the following commands to extract the packages and copy them to `{your_3rd_party_path}`:

    ```bash
    tar -xzf opensource.tar.gz
    mkdir -p {your_3rd_party_path}
    cp -r opensource/* {your_3rd_party_path}/
    ```

  - Method 2: Download the third-party open-source software packages one by one via the links in the list.

    Create a `{your_3rd_party_path}` directory in the build environment to store the third-party open-source software.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p {your_3rd_party_path}/patch
    ```

    Upload the downloaded packages according to the following rules:

    - Upload the makeself patch file `makeself-2.5.0.patch` to the `{your_3rd_party_path}/patch` directory, and upload the other packages (including `makeself-release-2.5.0.tar.gz`) directly to `{your_3rd_party_path}`.
    - Keep the uploaded file names the same as those in the download addresses.

  After completing either of the preceding methods, run the following command to perform the build:

  ```bash
  bash build.sh --cann_3rd_lib_path={your_3rd_party_path}
  ```

After the build is successful, the `cann-hixl_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run` file is generated in the `build_out` directory.

- `${cann_version}`: CANN version.
- `${arch}`: CPU architecture, such as `aarch64` and `x86_64`.
- For more execution options, run `-h` or refer to the following table.

  ```bash
  bash build.sh -h
  ```

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|---|---|---|
| `-h, --help` | Displays help information. | - |
| `-v, --verbose` | Displays detailed compilation commands. | - |
| `-j<N>` | Sets the number of threads used for build. | 8 |
| `--build_type=<Release\|Debug>`<br>`--build-type=<Release\|Debug>` | Sets the build type. | Release |
| `--cann_3rd_lib_path=<PATH>`<br>`--cann-3rd-lib-path=<PATH>` | Sets the installation path of the third-party dependency packages. | `./third_party` |
| `--output_path=<PATH>`<br>`--output-path=<PATH>` | Sets the build output path. | `./build_out` |
| `--pkg` | Builds a `.run` file (reserved). | - |
| `--pkg-type=<TYPE>` | Specifies the package type (`run`, `rpm`, `deb`, or `all`). | `run` |
| `--examples` | Builds the sample and benchmark test. | OFF |
| `--host` | Builds the host package only and skips device build/packaging. | OFF |
| `--experimental` | Enables experimental features. Code under `src/experimental/` is compiled and packaged when enabled. | OFF |
| `--asan` | Enables address sanitization for memory leak detection. | OFF |
| `--cov` | Enables code coverage. | OFF |
| `--sign-script=<PATH>`<br>`--sign_script=<PATH>` | Sets the path for the signature script. | - |
| `--enable-sign` | Enables the signature function. | - |

By default, the build compiles both host and device artifacts and outputs only the `cann-hixl_*.run` package to `build_out`.

When `--host` is specified, the device subproject under `src/ops` is not built, and the device package is not packed into `build_out`. Installing that run package keeps the existing device part and updates only the host part; uninstall still removes everything.

If you use `--host` for source build and runtime deployment, the runtime environment must have the ops full package or a signed hixl subpackage installed in advance, and the source version must match the run package version. A `--host` build does not guarantee cross-version execution compatibility with the runtime environment full package.

For source builds, if you do not modify the source code or your changes do not involve code under `src/ops`, it is recommended to add `--host` for the build.

When `--experimental` is specified, C++ sources under `src/experimental/` are compiled into `libcann_hixl.so`, and Python modules under `src/experimental/python/` are injected into the `hixl` wheel. Disabled by default with no impact on existing functionality.

## Local Verification (Tests)

Use the test cases in the `tests` directory for local verification.

- Install Dependencies

    ```bash
    # Install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file under the root directory
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  To view the test coverage locally, install `coverage` and add the Python 3 binary path to the `PATH` environment variable.

     ```shell
     pip3 install coverage
     # Replace `PYTHON3_HOME` with the actual Python installation directory
     export PATH=$PATH:$PYTHON3_HOME/bin
     ```

- Execute Test Cases

    ```bash
    # Default installation path (root user: /usr/local/Ascend/; non-root user: ${HOME}/Ascend)
    bash tests/run_test.sh
    # If you have uploaded the third-party open-source software package to {your_3rd_party_path}, run the following command:
    bash tests/run_test.sh --cann_3rd_lib_path={your_3rd_party_path}
    ```

- For more execution options, run `-h`.

  ```bash
  bash tests/run_test.sh -h
  ```

- Expected Results and Troubleshooting:
    - Test pass: `build success!` is printed during the build phase; no red message `!!! ... TEST FAILED, PLEASE CHECK YOUR CHANGES !!!` appears during execution; the script exits normally.
    - C++ test failure: A red message `!!! CPP TEST FAILED, PLEASE CHECK YOUR CHANGES !!!` is printed, along with the failed command and log path (for example, `log: <log_file>`). Run `cat <log_file>` to view details. To rerun a specific suite, run `bash tests/run_test.sh -t cpp -s <suite>`. `<suite>` can be: `llm_datadist`, `adxl`, `channel_pool`, `hixl`, `ubmem`.
    - Python test failure: A red message `!!! PY TEST FAILED, PLEASE CHECK YOUR CHANGES !!!` is printed, and unittest prints the failure stack trace for locating the issue. To rerun only Python tests, run `bash tests/run_test.sh -t py`.
    - Build failure: `build failed.` is printed. Check whether CANN environment variables are loaded and third-party dependencies are complete based on the error message.

## Installation

Install the `.run` file generated during [Compile Source Code](#source-code-compilation).

- Note that the installation path (default or specified) must be the same as the path where the Toolkit package is installed.

```bash
# To specify an installation path, add --install-path=${cann_install_path}
./cann-hixl_${cann_version}_linux-${arch}.run --full --quiet --pylocal
```

- --`full`: full installation mode
- --`quiet`: silent installation, skipping human-machine interaction.
- --`pylocal`: whether to install the `.whl` package to the HIXL installation path.
    - If selected, the `.whl` package is installed under `${cann_install_path}/cann/python/site-packages`.
    - If not selected, `.whl` is installed in the local python path, for example, `/usr/local/python3.7.5/lib/python3.7/site-packages`.
- For more installation options, run `--help`.

### Supplementary Notes on Signature

- The compiled `cann-hixl_<version>_linux-<arch>.run` package contains `cann-hixl-compat.tar.gz` (HIXL-compatible upgrade package).
- The `cann-hixl-compat.tar.gz` package is loaded to the device during service startup and is verified by the driver for security purpose.
- Source-built `cann-hixl-compat.tar.gz` does not contain a signature header. Therefore, you must disable the driver's signature verification mechanism.
- Disable signature verification as follows:
  - Disabling signature verification depends on the Ascend NPU driver software package (Ascend HDK 25.5.T2.B001 or later). Use the `npu-smi` tool matching Ascend HDK to query the version and disable signature verification. For details, see [Query Basic Information](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1100540362/4a8adb57?idPath=23710424|251366513|254884019|261408772|252764743), [Set Custom Signature Verification Capability Status](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1100540362/3152813c?idPath=23710424|251366513|254884019|261408772|252764743), and [Set Signature Verification Mode](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1100540362/a484ba7b?idPath=23710424|251366513|254884019|261408772|252764743). Run the commands on a physical machine as the `root` user.
  - The following commands use device 0 as an example (where `-i` specifies the device ID):

    ```shell
    npu-smi info # Query basic information, including the driver version
    npu-smi set -t custom-op-secverify-enable -i 0 -d 1 # Enable custom signature verification
    npu-smi set -t custom-op-secverify-mode -i 0 -d 0 # Disable signature verification
    ```

**After the installation is complete, you can run the sample test by referring to [Sample Running](../../examples/README.md) or run the benchmark test by referring to [Benchmarks](../../benchmarks/README.md).**
