### 1. Code Design

##### Rule 1.1 Validate all external data for legitimacy, including but not limited to: function parameters, external input command lines, files, environment variables, user data, etc.

##### Rule 1.2 Prefer return values to pass function execution results; avoid using output parameters

```cpp
FooBar *Func(const std::string &in);
```

##### Recommendation 1.3 Clean up invalid, redundant, or never-executed code

Although most modern compilers can warn about invalid or never-executed code in many cases, you should respond to warnings by identifying and clearing them; you should proactively identify invalid statements or expressions and remove them from the code.

> **Note**: Business code often pre-defines reserved parameters for specific scenarios (e.g., reserved function parameters, reserved struct fields). These parameters may currently be unreferenced but are reasonable engineering reservations and should not be marked as FAIL during review.
>
> The following cases may be marked as SUSPICIOUS for developer reference:
> - Obvious dead code (e.g., code blocks permanently excluded by conditional compilation)
> - Large blocks of commented-out code (git should be used to manage history)
> - Variables or expressions that are clearly invalid and have no reserved intent

##### Rule 1.4 Supplementary specifications for the C++ exception mechanism

###### Rule 1.4.1 Specify the exception type to catch; do not catch all exceptions

```cpp
// Incorrect example
try {
  // do something;
} catch (...) {
  // do something;
}
// Correct example
try {
  // do something;
} catch (const std::bad_alloc &e) {
  // do something;
}
```

---

### 2. Headers and Preprocessing

##### Rule 2.1 Use new standard C++ headers

```cpp
// Correct example
#include <cstdlib>
// Incorrect example
#include <stdlib.h>
```

##### Rule 2.2 Circular header dependency is prohibited

Circular header dependency means that a.h includes b.h, b.h includes c.h, and c.h includes a.h, which causes any modification to any one header file to trigger recompilation of all code that includes a.h/b.h/c.h. Circular header dependency directly reflects unreasonable architectural design and can be avoided by optimizing the architecture.

##### Recommendation 2.3 Avoid including headers that are not used

> **Note**: Unused headers increase compilation dependencies and compilation time. However, some headers may be reserved for future feature expansion or used to provide forward declarations. During review, these should only be noted as reminders, not forced to FAIL.

##### Rule 2.4 Do not reference external function interfaces or variables through extern declarations

##### Rule 2.5 Do not include headers within extern "C"

##### Recommendation 2.6 Avoid using `using` to import namespaces in header files

The propagation scope of `using namespace` in a header file depends on its scope:
- **file-scope** (outside any namespace): propagates to all translation units that include the header
- **namespace-scoped** (inside `namespace X {}`): only propagates to code that reopens the same namespace

> **Project-internal namespace exemption**: Importing project-internal namespaces (controlled by the project, low collision risk) is not flagged.

**FAIL conditions** (any one triggers FAIL, but harm analysis must be done first before grading):

1. **file-scope `using namespace` appears before subsequent `#include` in the same file** — subsequent includes are compiled in that namespace context
2. **Shared header paths** (e.g., `include/` and other public directories) import large namespaces (`std`, etc.) at file-scope

> **Before grading, the propagation chain must be traced to assess actual harm; structural violation ≠ substantive harm:**
>
> 1. **Confirm using scope**: If inside a `namespace X {}` block, it is only visible to X and does not leak to the includer's file-scope — **not file-scope pollution**
> 2. **Trace include chain**: If the include guard of the polluted header was already activated by an earlier header before the using, then **pollution did not actually occur**
> 3. **Check sub-header autonomy**: If the sub-header has its own identical `using namespace`, the external pollution is **redundant** with no added risk
> 4. **Grade**: Real new pollution → FAIL; structural violation without substantive harm → SUSPICIOUS, note the reason

**SUSPICIOUS conditions** (flag as reminder, do not force FAIL):

- Non-shared headers importing large namespaces (`std`, etc.) at file-scope
- Public API headers (`include/` directory) importing non-project namespaces (included by external callers)
- Shared headers importing large namespaces **inside** a namespace (not file-scope)

##### Rule 2.7 Include headers in a reasonable order

In `.cpp`/`.cc` source files, `#include` directives should be arranged in the following order:

1. The header file corresponding to this file (e.g., `foo.h` for `foo.cc`)
2. C/C++ standard library headers (e.g., `<string>`, `<vector>`, `<cstring>`)
3. System library headers (e.g., `<unistd.h>`, `<arpa/inet.h>`)
4. Other third-party library headers (e.g., `securec.h`, `nlohmann/json.hpp`)
5. Other headers within this project (e.g., `common/hixl_log.h`, `engine/client_handler.h`)

Placing the corresponding header first surfaces any implicit dependency of the header itself at the earliest opportunity when compiling this translation unit. Arranging the remaining includes from "stable/generic" to "project-specific" clarifies dependency sources and facilitates troubleshooting and trimming.

```cpp
// foo.cc
#include "foo.h"    // 1. The corresponding header
#include <cstring>  // 2. C/C++ standard library
#include <vector>
#include <unistd.h>           // 3. System library
#include "securec.h"          // 4. Other third-party library
#include "common/hixl_log.h"  // 5. Other headers within this project
#include "engine/bar.h"
```

> **Note**: During review, mark obviously disordered include sequences (e.g., the corresponding header placed after standard library headers, or project headers interleaved among standard library headers) as SUSPICIOUS to remind developers to adjust.

##### Rule 2.8 Headers must be self-contained

A header must directly include the headers for all symbols it directly uses, so that compiling a translation unit consisting only of `#include "the header"` succeeds, without relying on other headers being included first by an external translation unit.

```cpp
// Incorrect (not self-contained): uint64_t/uintptr_t come from <cstdint>, which is not included
#include <vector>
inline uint64_t PtrToValue(const void *ptr);
// Correct: add #include <cstdint> (and <cstddef> for size_t)
```

**Verification**: Write a `.cc` that includes only the header under test and compile it with `g++ -fsyntax-only` using the project's real include paths; it must pass.

**Grading**:
- **FAIL**: Compiling a translation unit that includes only this header fails (missing the include for a symbol it directly uses)
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Compilation passes but the actually-used headers are not directly included and rely on transitive dependencies (remind to add them per IWYU; not a forced FAIL)

---

### 3. Data Types

##### Recommendation 3.1 Avoid abusing typedef or #define to alias basic types

##### Rule 3.2 Use using instead of typedef to define type aliases to avoid shotgun modifications caused by type changes

```cpp
// Correct example
using FooBarPtr = std::shared_ptr<FooBar>;
// Incorrect example
typedef std::shared_ptr<FooBar> FooBarPtr;
```

---

### 4. Constants

##### Rule 4.1 Do not use macros to represent constants

##### Rule 4.2 Do not use hard-to-understand literals

A hard-to-understand literal is a literal whose business meaning cannot be clearly determined from the surrounding code context, including integer, floating-point, boolean, and string literals. Whether a literal is hard to understand is not black and white; it must be judged against the code context and business knowledge. For example, for the same integer literal 1000, `value = 1000;` conveys no meaning, whereas `millisecond = second * 1000;` can be understood as the ratio for converting seconds to milliseconds.

```cpp
// Incorrect example: the integer literals 1 and 2 are used directly, and which type each represents is unclear
int current_type = in_param->GetValue("servType");
if (current_type == 1) {
  ...
} else if (current_type == 2) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}

// Incorrect example: naming constants after the numbers themselves does not aid understanding
constexpr uint32_t kNumberOne = 1;
constexpr uint32_t kNumberTwo = 2;

// Correct example: use constants that convey the meaning
enum ServType {
  SERV_TYPE_RESERVED,
  SERV_TYPE_SET,
  SERV_TYPE_QUERY,
  ...
};

int current_type = in_param->GetValue("servType");
if (current_type == SERV_TYPE_SET) {
  ...
} else if (current_type == SERV_TYPE_QUERY) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

Remediation: if a literal is used frequently and carries a fixed meaning in its context, define it as a named constant or an enum. The name should be self-explanatory; if it is not, add a comment to clarify. Exception: if a literal is used in only one place and does not need to be extracted as a constant, add a comment explaining its meaning.

##### Recommendation 4.3 Each constant should have a single responsibility

---

### 5. Variables

##### Rule 5.1 Prefer namespaces to manage global constants. If there is a direct relationship with a class, static member constants may be used

```cpp
namespace foo {
constexpr int kGlobalVar = 1;  // global constant managed by namespace

class Bar {
 private:
  static int static_member_var_;
};
}  // namespace foo
```

##### Rule 5.2 Avoid using global variables; use the singleton pattern with caution and avoid abuse

##### Rule 5.3 Do not reference a variable again within an expression that contains its own increment or decrement operation

##### Rule 5.4 Pointer variables pointing to resource handles or descriptors must be assigned a new value or set to NULL immediately after the resource is released

##### Rule 5.5 Do not use uninitialized variables

---

### 6. Expressions

##### Recommendation 6.1 Comparisons in expressions should follow the principle that the left side tends to change and the right side tends to remain constant

```cpp
// Correct example
if (ret != SUCCESS) {
  ...
}

// Incorrect example
if (SUCCESS != ret) {
  ...
}
```

##### Rule 6.2 Use parentheses to clarify operator precedence and avoid low-level errors

```cpp
// Correct example
if (cond1 || (cond2 && cond3)) {
  ...
}

// Incorrect example
if (cond1 || cond2 && cond3) {
  ...
}
```

---

### 7. Casting

##### Rule 7.1 Use the type casts provided by C++ instead of C-style casts; avoid using const_cast and reinterpret_cast

---

### 8. Control Statements

##### Rule 8.1 switch statements must have a default branch

##### Rule 8.2 Loop counter type must match the width of the boundary value type being compared

The integer type width of a loop counter must not be narrower than the value type of the loop boundary expression. Otherwise, the counter may overflow or wrap around before reaching the boundary, causing an infinite loop or out-of-bounds access.

**Common error patterns:**

| Counter Type | Boundary Type | Risk |
|-------------|---------------|------|
| `uint32_t` | `size_t` (64-bit) | Wraps to 0 → infinite loop |
| `int32_t` | `size_t` (64-bit) | Overflows to negative → implicit conversion to very large `size_t` → out-of-bounds |
| `uint16_t` | `uint32_t` | Wraps to 0 → infinite loop |

**Incorrect examples:**

```cpp
// Incorrect — uint32_t counter vs size_t boundary; infinite loop when size exceeds UINT32_MAX
for (uint32_t i = 0U; i < data_vec.size(); ++i) { ... }

// Incorrect — int32_t counter vs size_t boundary; overflows to negative then implicitly promoted to very large size_t
for (int32_t i = 0; i < data_vec.size(); ++i) { ... }
```

**Correct examples:**

```cpp
// Correct — counter type matches the return type of size()
for (size_t i = 0; i < data_vec.size(); ++i) { ... }

// Correct — use range-based for to avoid type mismatch
for (auto &item : data_vec) { ... }
```

---

### 9. Declaration and Initialization

##### Rule 9.1 Do not use `memcpy_s` or `memset_s` to initialize non-POD objects

---

### 10. Pointers and Arrays

##### Rule 10.1 Do not hold the pointer returned by std::string's c_str()

```cpp
// Incorrect example
const char *a = std::to_string(12345).c_str();
```

##### Rule 10.2 Prefer unique_ptr over shared_ptr

##### Rule 10.3 Use std::make_shared instead of new to create shared_ptr

```cpp
// Correct example
std::shared_ptr<FooBar> foo = std::make_shared<FooBar>();
// Incorrect example
std::shared_ptr<FooBar> foo(new FooBar());
```

##### Rule 10.4 Use smart pointers to manage objects; avoid using new/delete

##### Rule 10.5 Do not use auto_ptr

##### Rule 10.6 For pointer and reference parameters, if they do not need to be modified, const must be used

##### Rule 10.7 When an array is used as a function parameter, its length must also be passed as a function parameter

```cpp
int ParseMsg(BYTE *msg, size_t msgLen) {
  ...
}
```

---

### 11. Strings

##### Rule 11.1 When performing storage operations on strings, ensure the string has a '\0' terminator

---

### 12. Assertions

##### Rule 12.1 Assertions must not be used to check errors that may occur during runtime; such runtime errors must be handled with error-handling code

---

### 13. Classes and Objects

##### Rule 13.1 Use delete to release a single object; use delete[] to release an array object

```cpp
const int kSize = 5;
int *number_array = new int[kSize];
int *number = new int();
...
delete[] number_array;
number_array = nullptr;
delete number;
number = nullptr;
```

##### Rule 13.2 Do not use std::move on const objects

##### Rule 13.3 Strictly use virtual/override/final to modify virtual functions

```cpp
class Base {
 public:
  virtual void Func();
};

class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  void Func() override;
};

class FinalDerived : public Derived {
 public:
  void Func() final;
};
```

##### Rule 13.4 Member functions that do not modify member variables must be declared const

> **Note**: A const member function promises the caller that it will not modify the object's member variables, which helps the compiler perform correctness checks and is the foundation of const-correctness. "Modify member variables" here is defined by C++ syntax: writing directly to a non-mutable member of this, or obtaining a writable reference through a non-const member accessor (e.g., the non-const overload of operator[]). Modifying objects pointed to by reference or pointer parameters (even if those objects are elements of this's containers) is not constrained by const and does not constitute a violation. If a member function does not access any member variables or member functions (i.e., does not depend on this), prefer the static modifier over const to explicitly express that the function is independent of the object instance. During review, mark as SUSPICIOUS to remind developers to add const or change to static.

```cpp
class Config {
 public:
  // ✅ getters do not modify members, declared as const
  const std::string &GetName() const {
    return name_;
  }
  int GetSize() const {
    return size_;
  }

  // ❌ getter without const; callers cannot invoke it on const objects
  const std::string &GetName() {
    return name_;
  }

  void SetName(const std::string &name) {
    name_ = name;
  }  // modifies a member, not const

 private:
  std::string name_;
  int size_ = 0;
};
```

##### Recommendation 13.5 Do not throw exceptions from destructors

> **Note**: Since C++11, destructors are implicitly `noexcept`. If a destructor throws an exception, `std::terminate` will be triggered and the program will crash; if a destructor throws during stack unwinding (while another exception is still being processed), `std::terminate` will also be triggered. Destructors must guarantee not to throw exceptions. When a cleanup operation may fail, the exception should be caught inside the destructor and logged. During review, mark as SUSPICIOUS to remind developers to fix it.

```cpp
class FileWriter {
 public:
  // ❌ destructor throws an exception, triggering std::terminate and crashing the program
  ~FileWriter() {
    if (!Flush()) {
      throw std::runtime_error("flush failed");
    }
  }

 private:
  bool Flush();
};

class SafeFileWriter {
 public:
  // ✅ destructor catches exceptions and logs them, does not propagate upward
  ~SafeFileWriter() noexcept {
    try {
      if (!Flush()) {
        // log error
      }
    } catch (const std::exception &e) {
      // log error and swallow the exception
    }
  }

 private:
  bool Flush();
};
```

---

### 14. Function Design

##### Rule 14.1 Use RAII to help track dynamic allocations

```cpp
// Correct example
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  ...
}
```

##### Rule 14.2 When using lambdas in a non-local scope, avoid capture by reference

```cpp
// Incorrect example: capturing a local variable by reference and submitting it to a thread pool;
// the reference dangles after the scope ends
{
  int local_var = 1;
  auto func = [&]() {
    ...
    std::cout << local_var << std::endl;
  };
  thread_pool.commit(func);
}

// Correct example: capture the needed data by value
{
  int local_var = 1;
  auto func = [local_var]() { std::cout << local_var << std::endl; };
  thread_pool.commit(func);
}
```

##### Rule 14.3 Virtual functions must not use default parameter values

##### Recommendation 14.4 Use strongly-typed parameters\member variables; avoid using void*

##### Recommendation 14.5 Functions should have a single responsibility

Functions with a single responsibility are easier to understand and maintain. Functions that are not single-responsibility should be further split or layered.

The following dimensions can be used to indirectly measure whether a function has a single responsibility:

- **Number of lines**: no more than 50 lines (excluding blank lines and comments) recommended
- **Number of parameters**: no more than 5 recommended
- **Maximum block nesting depth**: no more than 4 levels recommended (if/for/while/switch/try and macro expansion blocks)

> **Note**: When nesting depth exceeds 4 levels, extract helper functions or use early return to simplify control flow; when a function is too long, split it into multiple smaller functions by responsibility; when there are too many parameters, consider encapsulating strongly-related parameters into a struct. During review, mark as SUSPICIOUS to remind developers to optimize.

---

### 15. Function Usage

##### Recommendation 15.1 Keep function parameter order consistent within the same file (or module)

> **Note**: "Input parameters first, output parameters last" is not enforced. As long as the parameter order style is uniform within the same file, it is acceptable (e.g., consistently using input-first, or consistently using output-first). During review, use the style of the majority of functions in the file as the baseline and only flag clearly inconsistent cases.

```cpp
// ✅ Consistent style: all input-first
bool FuncA(const std::string &in, FooBar *out1, FooBar *out2);
bool FuncB(int val, Result *out);

// ✅ Consistent style: all output-first
bool FuncC(FooBar *out1, FooBar *out2, const std::string &in);
bool FuncD(Result *out, int val);

// ❌ Inconsistent: mixed within the same file
bool FuncE(const std::string &in, FooBar *out);  // input-first
bool FuncF(Result *out, int val);                // output-first → style inconsistency
```

##### Recommendation 15.2 When passing function parameters, use `const T &` for input and `T &` or `T *` for output

> **Note**: Output parameters may use references (`T &`) or pointers (`T *`). In practice, `T &` is the more common output parameter style (especially for scalar outputs and structs), while `T *` is more common when nullable semantics are needed. Reviews should not require output parameters to be pointers, but the style should be consistent within the same file.

```cpp
// ✅ Output via reference (common style)
bool Func(const std::string &in, FooBar &out1, FooBar &out2);

// ✅ Output via pointer (nullable semantics style)
bool Func(const std::string &in, FooBar *out1, FooBar *out2);

// ❌ Mixed within the same file (style inconsistency)
void FuncA(const Input &in, Output &out);  // output via reference
void FuncB(const Input &in, Output *out);  // output via pointer → style inconsistency within the same file
```

##### Rule 15.3 When passing function parameters in scenarios that do not involve ownership, use T * or const T & as parameters instead of smart pointers

```cpp
// Correct example
bool Func(const FooBar &in);
// Incorrect example
bool Func(std::shared_ptr<FooBar> in);
```

##### Rule 15.4 When passing function parameters, if ownership needs to be transferred, it is recommended to use shared_ptr + move

```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  explicit Foo(std::shared_ptr<T> x) : x_(std::move(x)) {}

 private:
  std::shared_ptr<T> x_;
};
```

##### Rule 15.5 Single-argument constructors must use explicit; multi-argument constructors must not use explicit

```cpp
explicit Foo(int x);             // good
explicit Foo(int x, int y = 0);  // good
Foo(int x, int y = 0);           // bad
explicit Foo(int x, int y);      // bad
```

##### Rule 15.6 Copy constructors and copy assignment operators should appear in pairs or be prohibited

```cpp
class Foo {
 private:
  Foo(const Foo &) = default;
  Foo &operator=(const Foo &) = default;
  Foo(Foo &&) = delete;
  Foo &operator=(Foo &&) = delete;
};
```

##### Rule 15.7 Do not store or delete pointer parameters

##### Recommendation 15.8 All declarations of a function must have parameter names consistent with its definition

> **Note**: The C++ standard does not require parameter names to be consistent between a declaration and its definition, but inconsistent parameter names reduce readability and increase review and maintenance costs. During review, mark as SUSPICIOUS to remind developers to keep them consistent.

> **Scope**: Applies to all C++ functions, including functions declared in headers, class member functions, and forward declarations within the same file. If parameter names are omitted in a declaration (only types present), it is not considered inconsistent.

```cpp
// foo.h
bool ParseConfig(const std::string &config_path, int max_retry, bool enable_log);

// foo.cpp
// ✅ parameter names consistent between declaration and definition
bool ParseConfig(const std::string &config_path, int max_retry, bool enable_log) {
  ...
}

// ❌ parameter names inconsistent between declaration and definition
bool ParseConfig(const std::string &path, int retry_count, bool log) {
  ...
}

// ✅ parameter names omitted in the declaration; not considered inconsistent
bool ParseConfig(const std::string &, int, bool);
```
